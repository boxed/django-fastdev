Changelog
---------

1.7.3
~~~~~

* Strict `{% if %}` put the 500 debug page into an infinite loop


1.7.2
~~~~~

* Fixed: include template tags in source distribution


1.7.1
~~~~~

* Fix for bug in gitignore validation


1.7.0
~~~~~

* New template tag: '{% ifexists foo %}{% elifexists bar %}{% else %}{% endifexists %}` to use instead of `{% if %}` to check if a variable exists in the context.

* Warn if you use `{% if %}` to check for existance of a variable (really warn if it triggers false if the lookup fails)

* New setting: `FASTDEV_STRICT_IF`. Set this to `True` to make `{% if %}` crash on non-existant variables. This setting will very likely break some of the Django admin, because it relies on this behavior!


* Check that the venv and pycache stuff is in .gitignore


1.6.0
~~~~~

* Non-existant variable accessed inside an `{% if %}` didn't crash.

* Warning on invalid fk field name. So for example using `car_id = ForeignKey(Car)` will now warn and explain what you should do.


1.5.0
~~~~~

* .gitignore validation

* Removed accidental debug print left in the code.
